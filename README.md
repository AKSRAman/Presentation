# Graphql integration with node and react

Here we will discuss how graphql works with our server and client

### Before going to discuss about these things we will take an overview About React , Node and GraphQL



## What is Node js ?
Node.js is a back-end JavaScript runtime environment, runs on the V8 JavaScript Engine, and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.



## What is React ?
React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components.



## What is GraphQL
GraphQL is a query language and server-side runtime for application programming interfaces (APIs) that prioritizes giving clients exactly the data they request and no more. GraphQL is designed to make APIs fast, flexible, and developer-friendly.
